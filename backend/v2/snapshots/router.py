"""
Snapshot management endpoints for handling epoch state transitions and reward calculations.

This module provides endpoints for managing the snapshot lifecycle, including:
1. Pending snapshot creation and simulation
2. Finalized snapshot creation and simulation
3. Snapshot status tracking
4. Reward calculations and distributions

Key Concepts:
    - Snapshot Lifecycle:
        - Pending: Created at the beginning of the decision window
            (If we have pending epoch state but no pending snapshot
                we consider this as pre-pending state)
        - Finalized: Created at the end of the decision window
            (If we have finalized epoch state but no finalized snapshot
                we consider this as finalizing state)

    - Reward Calculations:
        - Staking Proceeds: ETH rewards from staking
        - Effective Deposits: User deposits weighted by time
        - Octant Rewards: Total rewards available for distribution
        - Matched Rewards: Additional rewards based on allocation patterns
        - Project Rewards: Quadratic funding distribution to projects
        - User Rewards: Direct withdrawals and allocations

    - Merkle Tree:
        - Used for efficient reward distribution verification
        - Contains proofs for all user and project rewards
        - Generated during finalization
        - Used for on-chain validation

    - Budget Components:
        - Staking Proceeds: Base rewards from staking
        - Operational Cost: System maintenance costs
        - Community Fund: Reserved for community initiatives
        - PPF (Patron Protection Fund): Reserved for patron rewards
        - Leftover: Unused rewards returned to staking

    - Epoch States:
        - Current: Active epoch
        - Pending: Epoch ended, allocation window open
        - Finalized: Allocation window closed, rewards distributed

    - Reward Distribution:
        - User Budgets: Based on effective deposits
        - Project Rewards: Based on quadratic funding
        - Matched Rewards: Based on allocation patterns
        - Patron Rewards: Special rewards for patron mode
        - Leftover: Returned to staking pool

    - Security Features:
        - Merkle tree for reward verification
        - State validation for snapshot creation
        - Duplicate prevention
        - Epoch state validation

    1. Get epoch time range (start to current timestamp)
    2. Calculate staking proceeds:
        - Mainnet: Based on aggregated transactions
        - Testnet: Based on contract balance

        - Process all deposit events
        - Weight deposits by time
        - Calculate total effective deposit
    4. Calculate octant rewards:
        - Based on staking proceeds and effective deposits
        - Include operational costs
        - Include community fund
        - Include PPF (Patron Protection Fund)
